    """Approximates the solution to an instance of the set cover problem.

    This solves the problem using the well-known greedy algorithm.
    The following is a description of the problem and solution to the
    most basic case, in which sets are unweighted and we seek to cover
    the entire universe:
    We are given are universe U of (hashable) objects and a collection
    of m subsets S_1, S_2, ..., S_m of U whose union equals U. We wish
    to approximate the smallest number of these subets whose union is U
    (i.e., "covers" the universe U). Pseudocode of the greedy algorithm
    is as follows:
      C <- {}
      while the universe is not covered (U =/= {}):
        Pick the set S_i that covers the most of U (i.e., maximizes
          | S_i _intersection_ U |)
        C <- C _union_ { S_i }
        U <- U - S_i
      return C
    The collection of subsets C is the approximate set cover and a
    valid set cover is always returned. The loop goes through min(|U|,m)
    iterations and picking S_i at each iteration takes O(m*D) time where
    D is the cardinality of the largest subset. The returned solution
    is a ceil(ln(D))-approximation. In the worst-case, where D=|U|, this
    is a ceil(ln(|U|))-approximation. Inapproximability results show
    that it is NP-hard to approximate the problem to within c*ln(|U|)
    for any 0 < c < 1. Thus, this is a very good approximation given
    what is possible.

    This generalizes the above case to support weighted, partial set
    cover. There are two primary changes to the above pseudocode that
    support this:
     - Rather than looping while the universe is not covered, we instead
       loop until we have covered as much as the universe as we desire
       to cover (where that amount is determined by the parameter
       indicating the fraction of the universe to cover). This change
       alone supports 'partial cover'.
     - Rather than picking the set S_i that covers the most of U, we
       instead pick the set S_i that minimizes the ratio of the cost
       of S_i (call it c_i) to the amount of the remaining universe, U,
       that S_i covers. Let r be the number of elements that have yet
       to be covered in order to obtain the desired partial cover; there
       is no reason to favor a set that covers more than r. Thus, in
       particular, we pick the set S_i that minimizes the quotient
       [ c_i / min(r, | S_i \intersect U |) ].
    As shown by Petr Slavik in the paper "Improved performance of the
    greedy algorithm for the minimum set cover and minimum partial cover
    problems", the obtained solution is a ceil(ln(D))-approximation,
    where D is the cardinality of the largest subset. It also obtains a
    ceil(ln(p*|U|))-approximation where p is the fraction of the universe
    we wish to cover. When p=1, D <= |U| and therefore the
    ceil(ln(D))-approximation is the stronger one. But when p<1, it is
    possible that D > p*|U| and hence the ceil(ln(p*|U|))-approximation
    would be stronger. Note that in the weighted case, the solution
    seeks to minimize the sum of the weights of the chosen sets and
    the approximation is with respect to this.

    Args:
        sets: dict mapping set identifiers to sets
        costs: dict mapping set identifiers to the costs (or weights)

            we must cover; the default is p=1, making this equivalent
            to the problem in which the entire universe is covered

    Returns:
        a set consisting of the identifiers of the sets chosen to be
        in the set cover. For example, if the sets input is
          { 0: S_1, 1: S_2, 2: S_3 }
        where each S_i is a set, and the sets S_1 and S_3 are
        chosen to be in the set cover, then the output is {0,2}.

    We define the "multiuniverse" set problem to be a version of the
    set cover problem in which there are multiple universes and we
    seek to find a collection of sets whose union covers a specified
    fraction of each given universe. The sets can contain elements
    from different universes; the input sets provide, for each set,
    which elements in which universes the set covers.

    Note that elements with the same value from different universes are
    effectively treated as different elements. For example, covering the
    element "42" from universe 2 does not necessarily cover the element
    "42" from universe 1 (unless a chosen set contains "42" from
    universe 2 as well as "42" from universe 1).

    Args:
        sets: dict mapping set identifiers to other dicts, which then
            map universe identifiers to sets of elements. That is,
            consider all the elements in some set set_id. sets[set_id]
            is a dict in which all the elements in set_id are split up
            by the universe they are a part of;
            sets[set_id][universe_id] is a set containing the elements
            in set_id that come from universe universe_id
        costs: dict mapping set identifiers to the costs (or weights)
            of the set; the default is for every set to have a cost of
            1, making this equivalent to the unweighted problem
        universe_p: dict mapping universe identifiers to floats in
            [0,1] that specifiy the fraction of the corresponding
            universe we must cover; the default is for the coverage
            fraction of each universe to be 1.0, making this equivalent
            to the problem in which there is a single universe (the
            union of all given universes) that must be completely
            covered
        ranks: dict mapping set identifiers to a rank (integer) for the
            set. The rank of a set makes it easy to define different
            levels of penalties on sets. If there are two sets A and B
            such that ranks[A] < ranks[B], then A will always be
            considered before B -- i.e., if coverage is needed and A
            provides that coverage, A will be chosen before B even if A
            provides less coverage than B would provide. When two sets
            have the same rank, then the costs of those sets are
            considered. In a sense, the ranks of two sets is given
            higher priority than the costs of those sets or the number
            of elements they cover; the ranks define different groups
            such that as much coverage as possible is sought from sets
            with lesser rank before considering sets with higher rank.
            [See implementation note below.]
        use_arrays: when True, the values inside the input 'sets' are
            expected to be stored in a Python array rather than in a
            Python set. Python sets require a considerable amount of
            overhead and, though the use of array is less time-efficient
            here, it can lead to substantial memory savings depending on
            the type of data.
        use_intervalsets: when True, the values inside the input 'sets'
            are expected to be stored as an instance of IntervalSet
            (one instance per set). For sets that contain many adjacent
            elements (i.e., stretches of contiguous integers), this
            should require less memory and less runtime than the use of
            Python sets or arrays. This cannot be true when 'use_arrays'
            is also True. This should only be used when the elements
            (usually integers) are well represented by intervals --
            i.e., they fit into contiguous stretches -- because otherwise
            this will run slowly compared to when the option is not set.
            If this is true and the value inside the input 'sets' at some
            entry is a tuple, then it is assumed that the set at that entry
            has just one interval (i.e., the one specified by the tuple),
            which is useful for saving space, and the interval is converted
            into an instance of IntervalSet as needed.

    Returns:
        a set consisting of the identifiers of the sets chosen to be
        in the set cover. For example, if the sets input is
          { 0: S_1, 1: S_2, 2: S_3 }
        where each S_i is a set, and the sets S_1 and S_3 are chosen
        to be in the set cover, then the output is {0,2}.

    Implementation notes:
      - The rank of a set can thought of as giving a sufficiently high
        cost to the set.  In fact, ranks are not at all necessary, as
        they can be emulated entirely using costs. We choose some
        sufficiently large constant C; C should be at least as large as
        the total number of elements across all the universes (e.g.,
        2^64).  Then, if we wish to assign some set a nonnegative rank
        r, we could instead take the cost of the set and multiply that
        cost by C^r prior to calling this function. That would have the
        same effect of delaying the consideration of the set until all
        sets with smaller ranks have been considered. However, while
        correct in theory, the method of using costs to emulate ranks is
        not practical. For example, if C=2^64 and r=100 for some set,
        then the cost of that set with r=100 would be its previous cost
        multiplied by (2^64)^100. While Python can compute this number,
        it cannot do floating point arithmetic with it and thus cannot
        consider its ratio in the weighted set cover approximation
        algorithm.
      - This is a generalization of the partial, weighted set cover
        problem whose solution is approximated by approx(..). (For any
        input to that function, simply create a single universe (e.g.,
        with id 0) whose elements consist of the union of all the input
        sets, and then create a new input sets to this function in which
        each original set set_id is instead found in sets[set_id][0].)
        Indeed, this function and approx(..) are very similar, with this
        one simply generalizing to allow for multiple universes.
        However, whereas approx(..) achieves a provable guarantee on the
        approximation factor, it is not clear whether the
        straightforward generalization implemented in this function
        achieves the same factor; therefore, there may be room for
        improvement in this function. Furthermore, the generalization to
        multiple universes will yield a slight increase in runtime
        (constant factors) compared to working directly with the more
        traditional notion of a single universe. For these reasons --
        although the approx(..) function could be greatly shortened by
        simply calling this function -- we choose to implement the
        versions separately.
      - In practice, often the computed minimum ratio in one iteration of
        the set cover algorithm is equal to the minimum ratio from the
        previous iteration. We exploit this fact to improve the running
        time of the greedy algorithm without affecting the output. We store
        the minimum ratio from the previous iteration (last_min_ratio) as
        well as all the sets whose ratio, as computed in that previous
        iteration, was equal to last_min_ratio
        (set_ids_with_same_ratio_as_last_min). On each iteration, we first
        check if there is a set whose ratio is equal to the last minimum
        ratio and is valid for being put into the set cover. Because the
        minimum ratio is nondecreasing as we step through iterations, such
        a set would have the minimum ratio on this iteration; thus, we
        simply add it to the set cover and progress to the next iteration
        of the greedy algorithm. If there is no such set, we must take
        the usual approach that would not use this heuristic -- i.e.,
        compute the ratios for all sets not yet in the set cover and find
        the set with the minimum ratio.
