"""Approximates the solution to an instance of the set cover problem
using the well-known greedy algorithm.

The following is a description of the problem and solution to the
most basic case, in which sets are unweighted and we seek to cover
the entire universe:
We are given are universe U of (hashable) objects and a collection
of m subsets S_1, S_2, ..., S_m of U whose union equals U. We wish
to approximate the smallest number of these subets whose union is U
(i.e., "covers" the universe U). Pseudocode of the greedy algorithm
is as follows:
  C <- {}
  while the universe is not covered (U =/= {}):
    Pick the set S_i that covers the most of U (i.e., maximizes
      | S_i \intersect U |)
    C <- C \union { S_i }
    U <- U - S_i
  return C
The collection of subsets C is the approximate set cover and a
valid set cover is always returned. The loop goes through min(|U|,m)
iterations and picking S_i at each iteration takes O(m*D) time where
D is the cardinality of the largest subset. The returned solution
is a ceil(ln(D))-approximation. In the worst-case, where D=|U|, this
is a ceil(ln(|U|))-approximation. Inapproximability results show
that it is NP-hard to approximate the problem to within c*ln(|U|)
for any 0 < c < 1. Thus, this is a very good approximation given
what is possible.

This generalizes the above case to support weighted, partial set
cover. There are two primary changes to the above pseudocode that
support this:
 - Rather than looping while the universe is not covered, we instead
   loop until we have covered as much as the universe as we desire
   to cover (where that amount is determined by the parameter
   indicating the fraction of the universe to cover). This change
   alone supports 'partial cover'.
 - Rather than picking the set S_i that covers the most of U, we
   instead pick the set S_i that minimizes the ratio of the cost
   of S_i (call it c_i) to the amount of the remaining universe, U,
   that S_i covers. Let r be the number of elements that have yet
   to be covered in order to obtain the desired partial cover; there
   is no reason to favor a set that covers more than r. Thus, in
   particular, we pick the set S_i that minimizes the quotient
   [ c_i / min(r, | S_i \intersect U |) ].
As shown by Petr Slavik in the paper "Improved performance of the
greedy algorithm for the minimum set cover and minimum partial cover
problems", the obtained solution is a ceil(ln(D))-approximation,
where D is the cardinality of the largest subset. It also obtains a
ceil(ln(p*|U|))-approximation where p is the fraction of the universe
we wish to cover. When p=1, D <= |U| and therefore the
ceil(ln(D))-approximation is the stronger one. But when p<1, it is
possible that D > p*|U| and hence the ceil(ln(p*|U|))-approximation
would be stronger. Note that in the weighted case, the solution
seeks to minimize the sum of the weights of the chosen sets and
the approximation is with respect to this.

The input 'sets' is a dict mapping set identifiers to sets. The
optional input 'costs' is a dict mapping set identifiers to the
costs (or weights) of the set; the default is for every set to have
a cost of 1, making this equivalent to the unweighted problem. The
optional input 'p' is a float in [0,1] that specifies the fraction
of the universe we must cover; the default is p=1, making this
equivalent to the problem in which the entire universe is covered.
The output is a set consisting of the identifiers of the sets chosen
to be in the set cover. For example, if the sets input is
  { 0: S_1, 1: S_2, 2: S_3 }
where each S_i is a set, and the sets S_1 and S_3 are chosen to be
in the set cover, then the output is {0,2}.

"""Approximates the solution to an instance of a version of the
set cover problem in which there are multiple universes and we
seek to find a collection of sets whose union covers a specified
fraction of each given universe.

The input 'sets' is a dict mapping set identifiers to other dicts,
which then map universe identifiers to sets of elements. That is,
consider all the elements in some set set_id. sets[set_id] is a dict
in which all the elements in set_id are split up by the universe
they are a part of; sets[set_id][universe_id] is a set containing
the elements in set_id that come from universe universe_id. The
optional input 'costs' is a dict mapping set identifiers to the
costs (or weights) of the set; the default is for every set to have
a cost of 1, making this equivalent to the unweighted problem. The
optional input 'universe_p' is a dict mapping universe identifiers
to floats in [0,1] that specifiy the fraction of the corresponding
universe we must cover; the default is for the coverage fraction of
each universe to be 1.0, making this equivalent to the problem in
which there is a single universe (the union of all given universes)
that must be completely covered.  The output is a set consisting of
the identifiers of the sets chosen to be in the set cover. For
example, if the sets input is
  { 0: S_1, 1: S_2, 2: S_3 }
where each S_i is a set, and the sets S_1 and S_3 are chosen to be
in the set cover, then the output is {0,2}.

Note that elements with the same value from different universes are
effectively treated as different elements. For example, covering the
element "42" from universe 2 does not necessarily cover the element
"42" from universe 1 (unless a chosen set contains "42" from
universe 2 as well as "42" from universe 1).

When 'use_arrays' is True, the values inside the input 'sets' are
expected to be stored in a Python array rather than in a Python set.
Python sets require a considerable amount of overhead and, though
the use of array is less time-efficient here, it can lead to
substantial memory savings depending on the type of data.

This is a generalization of the partial, weighted set cover problem
whose solution is approximated by approx(..). (For any input to that
function, simply create a single universe (e.g., with id 0) whose
elements consist of the union of all the input sets, and then create
a new input sets to this function in which each original set set_id
is instead found in sets[set_id][0].) Indeed, this function and
approx(..) are very similar, with this one simply generalizing to
allow for multiple universes. However, whereas approx(..) achieves a
provable guarantee on the approximation factor, it is not clear
whether the straightforward generalization implemented in this
function achieves the same factor; therefore, there may be room for
improvement in this function. Furthermore, the generalization to
multiple universes will yield a slight increase in runtime (constant
factors) compared to working directly with the more traditional
notion of a single universe. For these reasons -- although the
approx(..) function could be greatly shortened by simply calling
this function -- we choose to implement the versions separately.
