"""Dataset with 'Cache Valley virus' sequences.

A dataset with 3 'Cache Valley virus' sequences. The virus is
segmented and has 2 segments. Based on their strain and/or isolate,
these sequences were able to be grouped into 3 genomes. Many genomes
may have fewer than 2 segments.

Note that the sequences in this dataset are a subset of those in the
'bunyamwera' dataset.
