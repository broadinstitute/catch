"""Dataset with 'Sandfly fever Sicilian virus' sequences.

A dataset with 8 'Sandfly fever Sicilian virus' sequences. The virus
is segmented and has 3 segments. Based on their strain and/or isolate,
these sequences were able to be grouped into 7 genomes. Many genomes
may have fewer than 3 segments.
