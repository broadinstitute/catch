"""Dataset with 'Mopeia Lassa virus reassortant 29' sequences.

A dataset with 24 'Mopeia Lassa virus reassortant 29' sequences. The
virus is segmented and has 2 segments. Based on their strain and/or
isolate, these sequences were able to be grouped into 19 genomes. Many
genomes may have fewer than 2 segments.
