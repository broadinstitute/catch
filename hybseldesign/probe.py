  """A heuristic that outputs whether it is likely that self and
  other share at least one k-mer. Note that, depending on the
  sequences being compared and the parameter values, false negatives
  are a very real possibility.

  False negatives are possible (indeed even likely for two sequences
  with very few k-mers in common) and their probability of occurring
  depends on the number of k-mers in common and on num_kmers_to_test.

  This heuristic is intended primarily for determining whether it
  is possible that two sequences are 'redundant'. If two sequences
  are 'redundant', they ought to (by definition) share many k-mers
  and therefore this heuristic should have a small probability
  of giving outputting False (a false negative). If two sequences
  are not 'redundant', they should have few or no k-mers in common
  and therefore this heuristic should have a small probability of
  outputting True (a false positive). [In this paragraph, the notion
  of a false positive/negative relates to whether the sequences are
  'redundant', whereas in the earlier paragraph it relates to whether
  they share at least one k-mer.]

  In the case where two sequences are 'redundant', assume they have
  N k-mers in common. The probability of this outputting False
  (falsely indicating that the two are likely not redundant) is the
  probability that this heuristic does not select any of those N
  k-mers. That is:
    ( 1 - N/(len(seq)-k+1) )^{num_kmers_to_test}

  In the case where two sequences are not 'redundant', assume they
  are each produced at random with uniformity and independence across
  possible k-mers. The probability of this outputting True (falsely
  indicating that the two might be redundant) is the probability that
  this heuristic finds at least one k-mer in common. That is:
    1 - ( (1-(1/4)^k )^{len(seq)-k+1} )^{num_kmers_to_test}
