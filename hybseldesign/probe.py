  sequences being compared and the parameter values, false negatives
  are a very real possibility.

  False negatives are possible (indeed even likely for two sequences
  with very few k-mers in common) and their probability of occurring
  depends on the number of k-mers in common and on num_kmers_to_test.

  This heuristic is intended primarily for determining whether it
  is possible that two sequences are 'redundant'. If two sequences
  are 'redundant', they ought to (by definition) share many k-mers
  and therefore this heuristic should have a small probability
  of giving outputting False (a false negative). If two sequences
  are not 'redundant', they should have few or no k-mers in common
  and therefore this heuristic should have a small probability of
  outputting True (a false positive). [In this paragraph, the notion
  of a false positive/negative relates to whether the sequences are
  'redundant', whereas in the earlier paragraph it relates to whether
  they share at least one k-mer.]

  In the case where two sequences are 'redundant', assume they have
  N k-mers in common. The probability of this outputting False
  (falsely indicating that the two are likely not redundant) is the
  probability that this heuristic does not select any of those N
  k-mers. That is:
    ( 1 - N/(len(seq)-k+1) )^{num_kmers_to_test}

  In the case where two sequences are not 'redundant', assume they
  are each produced at random with uniformity and independence across
  possible k-mers. The probability of this outputting True (falsely
  indicating that the two might be redundant) is the probability that
  this heuristic finds at least one k-mer in common. That is:

"""Finds the ranges in sequence that each probe in a given set of
probes "covers" (i.e., should hybridize to), where coverage is
determined by a given function.

The probes in the values of kmer_probe_map make up the set of probes
for which we seek coverage. kmer_probe_map must map k-mers (of length
k) to a set of tuples, in which each tuple contains a probe
whose sequence contains the k-mer as well as the position of the
k-mer in the probe. This works by scanning through sequence, reading
the k-mer at each position, and looking this up in kmer_probe_map to
retrieve a set of probes that are "candidates" for covering sequence
around the current position. This aligns each candidate probe to
sequence around the shared k-mer and then calls
cover_range_for_probe_in_sequence_fn to determine whether the probe
"covers" sequence in this region, where coverage is determined by
that function. If that function returns None, there is no coverage,
and otherwise it returns the range covered by the probe. The
output of this function is a dict mapping probes to the set of
ranges that each "covers".

Note that kmer_probe_map is generated in a manner that randomly
selects a subset of the k-mers from each probe. Thus, this algorithm
is a Monte Carlo algorithm and may yield false negatives. That is,
it is possible that when scanning through the sequence we encounter
a region that a probe ought to cover, but none of the k-mers in
that region map to the probe in kmer_probe_map. This should be
unlikely as long as kmer_probe_map is generated with a small enough
k and large enough num_kmers_per_probe. (There is a balance: as k
decreases and num_kmers_per_probe increases there is a larger set
of "candidate" probes for covering a region, and the runtime of this
function increases.) Assume that there is a region that should be
covered by some probe of length L and that the region and the probe
share N k-mers. (Note that as k decreases, N should increase.) The
probability that this function does not detect the coverage is the
probability that none of those N k-mers in the probe are selected
when generating kmer_probe_map. That is:
    ( 1 - N/(L-k+1) )^{num_kmers_per_probe}

kmer_probe_map.
