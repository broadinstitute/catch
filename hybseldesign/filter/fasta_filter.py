"""Chooses only probes present in a given FASTA file.

This acts as a filter on the probes by returning a list of
probes from the given input probes. This keeps all probes
that are equal to a sequence in a FASTA file, thereby removing
all probes that are not a sequence in the file. It preserves
the order of the sequences in the FASTA file; i.e., the input
probes are re-arranged to match their order in the file.
