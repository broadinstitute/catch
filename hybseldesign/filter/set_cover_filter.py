"""Chooses candidate probes using a set cover approach.

In particular, reduces a set of candidate probes by treating the problem
as an instance of the set cover problem.

Each candidate probe is treated as a set whose elements consist of the
bases of the target genomes that the probe 'covers' (i.e., should
hybridize to). This uses a version of the problem in which there are
multiple universes -- each universe corresponds to one target genome,
and the solution obtained is guaranteed to cover at least some
specified fraction of each universe. That is, the selected probes
collectively cover a specified fraction of the bases in each target
genome.

There is an identification option that, when enabled, instructs the
filter to choose candidate probes that will make it easy -- after
hybrid selection and sequencing are performed -- to identify one
or more grouping(s) of the target genomes from a sample. (The input
target genomes are grouped. Each grouping could represent, for
example, a species; the candidate probes would then make it easy to
identify one or more species present in a sample.) Ideally, the
chosen candidate probes each "hit" just one grouping of the target
genomes, where a probe "hits" a grouping if it covers at least one
target genome in that grouping. Candidate probes that hit more than
one grouping (these would make identification more difficult) are
only chosen if absolutely necessary to achieve the desired coverage.
When identification is enabled, the specified coverage to achieve
should typically be small.

There is a 'blacklist' of genomes, whose sequences we do not want to
cover (e.g., human DNA when we are interested in extracting viral
sequences). Probes that cover a portion of these genomes are
penalized in finding the set cover solution. That is, this filter
tries to choose candidate probes that do NOT cover a portion of
the blacklisted genomes, and will only choose candidate probes that
DO cover a portion of these genomes if doing so is absolutely
necessary to achieve the desired coverage.

The preprocessing determines whether a (portion of a) probe covers a
sequence, and if so the portion of the sequence covered, by
considering the longest common substring with some number of
mismatches between a sequence and a probe.

        The "rank" of a candidate probe is a level of penalty for that
        probe, where higher ranks are more penalized. A set cover is sought
        that uses as many candidate probes from rank i as possible before
        considering probes with rank i+1. There are two considerations in
        computing ranks:
          - When identification is turned on (i.e., self.identify is True),
            the number of species that a probe "hits". Fewer hit species
            yields a smaller rank.
          - The number of bases in blacklisted genomes that the probe
            covers. Fewer covered bases yields a smaller rank.
        A probe that covers any part of a blacklisted genome will always
        receive a higher rank than a probe that does not. (This is achieved
        by first computing ranks using tuples of the form (x,y) where x=0
        for any probe that does not cover a blacklisted genome and x=1
        for a probe that does; y determines relative rank among those probes
        with the same x value. The tuple ranks are then converted into
        integer ranks by sorting the tuples.) When identification is
        enabled, a probe that hits more than one grouping (e.g., species)
        will always receive a higher rank than a probe that only hits one
        grouping (and does not cover any blacklisted genomes).

        When identification is not turned on, weighted set cover
        effectively does the following: (1) Covers as much of the target
        genomes as possible while minimizing the number of probes, without
        using any probe that covers any part of a blacklisted genome. (2)
        Covers whatever portions of the target genomes remain to be covered
        by using probes that cover parts of blacklisted genomes, while
        first seeking probes that cover less of the blacklisted genomes
        (i.e., even if probe B covers much more of the target genomes
        than probe A, A will be chosen before B if B covers a tiny bit
        more of the blacklisted genomes than A).
        When identification is turned on, weighted set cover: (1) Covers
        as much of the target genomes as possible while minimizing the
        number of probes, only using probes that hit one grouping. (2)
        Covers whatever portions of the target genomes remain to be covered
        while minimizing the number of probes, only using probes that hit
        two groupings, etc. (3) Considers probes that cover parts of
        blacklisted genomes, if there remains more of the target genomes to
