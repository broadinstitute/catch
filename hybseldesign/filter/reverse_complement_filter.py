"""Returns reverse complements (and originals) of each probe.

This acts as a filter on the probes by returning each input probe as
well as its reverse complement.

The number of output probes is twice the number of input probes.
In the output, the reverse complements are interspersed with
the original input probes --- i.e., if the input probes are
[P1, P2, P3], the output is [P1, P1r, P2, P2r, P3, P3r] where
Pnr is the reverse complement of Pn.
