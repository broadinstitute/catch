"""Reduces a set of candidate probes by treating the problem as an
instance of the dominating set problem.

Each probe is treated as a vertex in the graph. If two probes are
redundant (i.e., are deemed similar by a specified criterion) then
that redundancy is treated as an edge between the vertices
representing the two probes. In seeking to minimize the number of
probes while covering all probes (i.e., ensuring that every probe
is either chosen or is redundant to a chosen probe), we are solving
an instance of the dominating set problem.

We solve the problem by reducing it to an instance of set cover
and calling the utils.set_cover.approx function to compute an
approximate set cover. Because there is an L-reduction between
set cover and dominating set, the approximation guarantees from set
cover apply to the solution here.
