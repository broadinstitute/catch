"""Adds adapters to both ends of each input probe.

This acts as a filter on the probes by returning each input probe with
an adapter (short DNA sequence) prepended to its 5' end and an adapter
appended to its 3' end.

We need to place adapters (primers) on the end of each probe for use
in PCR. However, probes that "overlap" (roughly speaking) can cause
problems (explained later) in PCR if they are PCR'd together. Thus,
we wish to use k different adapters such that a set of probes that
do not "overlap" each other get a unique adapter and this set is
PCR'd together. Typically, in this use case k=2 is sufficient --
each adapter is either an 'A' adapter or a 'B' adapter -- and each
probe is given either an 'A' or 'B' adapter (on both ends); the
'A' adapter probes are PCR'd separately from the 'B' adapter probes.
If we could define "overlap" more precisely, we could construct a
graph in which each vertex corresponds to a probe and edges give
the probes that "overlap". We would then wish to color the vertices
with k colors so as to minimize the number of monochromatic edges
(i.e., minimize the number of edges whose two vertices have the
same color). The colors correspond to adapters, and this would
effectively provide us with sets of probes for each adapter that
minimize the overlap among probes that share an adapter. This is
the min k-partition problem (dual of the max k-cut problem).

However, the problem comes only from a more specific meaning of
"overlap". In particular, suppose a probe is 100 bp and an adapter
(on each end) is 20 bp, so that in total the synthesized probe is
140 bp. Problems arise after PCR when probes we desire have annealed
so as to deviate from 140 bp. Namely, this happens when probes
overlap in a way that allows them to "chain" together (in a sort of
ladder structure) that allows them to grow long. For example,
consider the following probes staggered across a target genome:
                   ----- ----- ----- -----
                      ----- ----- -----
These overlap in a way that (considering that complements arise
during PCR) would allow them to chain together. Thus, we would want
all probes on the top row to be given adapter 'A' and all on the
bottom row to be given adapter 'B'. This way, they will be PCR'd
separately. Now consider the following probes along a target genome:
                      -----   -----
                          -----
                          -----
This could arise if the two probes on the two bottom rows differ
in just one position (e.g., together they cover a variant) but
may still hybridize to the same sequence. While the probes could
hybridize to each other (specifically, the complement of one to
the other), this is not a problem. Rather, the problem is that, like
the example above, they could form a chain. So we would want to
assign the two probes on the top row each adapter 'A', and the two
bottom probes each adapter 'B'.

The problem itself is difficult: we want to find subsets of the
probes such that the probes in each subset overlap in a way that
could allow them to form a chain, and then assign each of the probes
in these subsets a different adapter. But there is a heuristic that
should be suitable here: we can treat the problem as an interval
scheduling problem.

For each target genome we scan to find where all of the probes would
hybridize. Based on the "intervals" where these hybridize, we select
the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals that span the target
genome (i.e., the maximum number of non-overlapping probes). We
find these by solving an instance of the interval scheduling problem
with a simple greedy algorithm. We assign all of these probes adapter
'A', and then assign all of the remaining probes adapter 'B'. (If we
have more than two adapters, and thus more than two PCR experiments,
we could solve the interval scheduling problem again on all of the
remaining probes, assign the selected ones adapter 'B' and the
further remaining ones adapter 'C', and so on..) This has some
downsides. For example, we are implicitly assuming that each probe
hybridizes just once in a target genome, while in reality it may
appear more than once. (We assign it adapter 'A' if it is ever
selected by the interval scheduling algoritm, even though it may
overlap with another adapter 'A' probe.) However, in general for
this use case it should be rare for a probe to appear a large number
of times in a single target genome. Another downside is that --
assuming each probe appears just once in a target genome -- there
will be no overlap (or potential for chain formation) among probes
with adapter 'A', whereas there may be overlap among probes with
adapter 'B'. However, while possible, it should be rare for probes
with adapter 'B' to overlap because, in this use case, the coverage
at any bp should generally stay below 2x.

We solve interval scheduling for each target genome. Each time, we
vote once (either 'A' or 'B') for each probe. (Each target genome
gives just one vote to each probe, or none if that probe does not
hybridize to the target genome.) But the distinction between 'A' and
'B' is arbitrary -- at a particular target genome, the two can be
exchanged with each other for all the probes. (That is, at a target
genome we could vote for 'A' instead of 'B' and vice-versa for each
probe.) We seek to maximize the sum, across all probes, of the
majority vote for the probe (to ensure a clear choice of adapter for
each probe). For a probe p, let V^A_p be the number of 'A' adapter
votes p receives, and let V^B_p be the number of 'B' votes. Then, we
seek to maximize, summed over all probes p, max(V^A_p, V^B_p). When
we add target genome n+1, we can either exchange all 'A' and 'B'
votes from that target genome or not. We exchange them if and only if
doing so yields a higher total sum than not doing so. We only need
to consider exchanging the votes for target genome n+1; assuming this
has already been done earlier for each of the n preceding target
genomes, when they were added, there is no need consider exchanging
votes from those. This process yields the maximum sum considering
exchanges of votes in each of the target genomes, and this can be
proven by induction on the number of target genomes.
