"""Returns probes where each 'N' base is replaced by real bases.

The 'N' base in a probe indicates an unknown -- i.e., the base
can either 'A', 'T', 'C', or 'G'.

This acts as a filter on the probes by returning, for each probe p:
 - if p does not contain an 'N' base, then p itself.
 - if p does contain one or more 'N' bases, then 4 or more probes
   in which the sequence is maintained except 'N' is expanded to
   be 'A', 'T', 'C', and 'G'.

For example, if a probe is 'ANA', then the following probes are
returned in place of 'ANA': 'AAA', 'ATA', 'ACA', 'AGA'. If a
probe is 'ANN', then the following probes are returned in place
of 'ANN': 'AAA', 'AAT', 'AAC', 'AAG', 'ATA', 'ATT', 'ATC', 'ATG',
'ACA', 'ACT', 'ACC', 'ACG', 'AGA', 'AGT', 'AGC', 'AGG'. If a
probe contains n 'N' bases, then 4^n probes are returned in place
of the probe.

The number of output probes is dependent on the number of 'N'
bases within each probe. The order of the input probes is
conserved -- i.e., the new, "expanded" probes are returned among
the other probes.

Since the number of output probes grows exponentially in the
number of 'N' bases within a probe, we can limit this with
the 'limit_n_expansion_randomly' parameter. When set to a nonnegative
integer, only limit_n_expansion_randomly 'N' bases are expanded;
these ones are chosen randomly. The other 'N' bases, if there
exist others, are randomly replaced with an unambiguous base.
When set to None, all 'N' bases are expanded.
