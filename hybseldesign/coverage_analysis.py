"""Provides analysis of a probe set for targeted genomes.

This computes the number of bp across each target genome that the
probes cover, as well as the percentage of each target genome that
the probes cover. It computes a percentage against the full
length of the target genome, as well as a percentage against the
length of the target genome when only counting unambiguous bases
(non-'N' bases). It also computes the average coverage that the
probes yield across each target genome: again, one value against
the full target genome and one against just the unambiguous bases.

A few notes about the percentage of bases covered (in each note,
assume that we specified a desired coverage of 100% when designing
the probes, though this could be generalized to any desired coverage):
 - The percentage of bases covered in the full target genome
   (including ambiguous bases) may be less than 100%. This is expected
   if the target genome contains ambiguous bases ('N') because these
   are not covered. However, if this coverage analysis is run on probes
   to which adapters have been added, it may also be less than 100%
   even if the target genome contains no ambiguous bases. The reason is
   that, when this finds the ranges covered by each probe, it includes
   the adapters; some number of mismatches may be "used up" by the
   adapter, leaving fewer mismatches at the end of the true probe for
   aligning to the sequence, and meaning that the bases at the end of
   the true probe fail to cover bases of the target genome that they
   were originally intended to cover. For example, suppose we have
   a probe "ATCG" which was intended to cover the sequence "ATCC" in
   a target genome. Now suppose that (2-base) adapters are added to the
   probe, making it "GGATCGCC" (left adapter is 'GG' and right adapter
   is 'CC'). Suppose that the region in the target genome around "ATCC"
   is "GTATCCCC". And suppose we design the probes allowing for one
   mismatch. The one mismatch is "used up" by the second base on the
   left adapter ('G' in the adapter mismatches with 'T' in the target
   genome), so the base 'C' at the end of "ATCC" is not covered. Running
   the coverage analysis before adding adapters to the probes should
   alleviate this, making the percentage 100% as desired.
 - The percentage of bases covered in the target genome, when only
   counting unambiguous bases, may be less than 100% when adapters have
   been added to probes. The reason is the same as above.
 - The percentage of bases covered in the target genome, when only
   counting unambiguous bases, may be more than 100%. This could happen
   when allowing mismatches. A probe could cover an ambiguous base
   (i.e., 'N') of a target genome by simply using a mismatch when
   aligning to that base. Then, the probes collectively cover more bases
   than there are unambiguous bases in the target genome, making the
   percentage more than 100%.
